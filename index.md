i'm using this site to host some games i'm working on

only one is loaded so far, and it's a work in progress build of "Hello, are you there?" (WebGL - Modern Web Browser)

Someone may ask "What's the password for Hello, are you there?"

First off, try to figure it out if you want.

But if you can't or don't want to, [here's a text file of the password, which you can read by clicking here.](https://mychade.github.io/hello/password.txt)
